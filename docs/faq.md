# FAQ

## Why is my balance 0 or not fully displayed when I want to send coins?
  
Congratulations! You just received new MRX coins through a stake!

After a stake happens, inputs above 1 million will split in half and will display as a payment to yourself in your wallet.
  
The balance shows 0 or less then normal because the staked input needs 960 confirmations on the chain to become spendable again. After these confirmations you will see the coins reflected in your balance.
  
Also check on the [Explorer](https://explorer.metrixcoin.com) if the coins appear in your nominated address. When you scroll down your tranasactions will likely display "coin stake". 
  
Raise a ticket on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZFqJu4c) if this is not reflected in that way.
